# Logistic_Regression_projects
This repository contains 2 projects on Linear Regression Algorithm
Project 1  (Titanic_survival)
    
    Trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased on the famous Titanic data set from kaggle using LOGISTIC REGRESSION 
    model
    
Project 2 (Click_on_add)

     In this project I used a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.
     and to create a LOGISTIC REGRESSION model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that 
     user.
